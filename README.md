> Powerful tab management for VS Code - Save, organize, and restore your editor tabs with smart grouping, Git branch tracking, and AI-powered auto-categorization

Inspired by the popular [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall) browser extension, this VS Code extension helps you manage dozens of open files efficiently.

## ✨ Features

### Core Tab Management
- 📦 **Save & Restore Tabs** - Quickly save individual tabs, multiple tabs, or entire groups
- 🔄 **Restore Options** - Choose to restore tabs with or without removing them from groups
- 🗑️ **Smart Removal** - Remove tabs with automatic pin status detection and optional force remove with confirmation
- 🎯 **Context Menu Integration** - All commands accessible via right-click on tree view items
- 🖱️ **Drag & Drop** - Reorganize tabs and groups with intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- 📊 **Reorder Tabs** - Reorganize tabs within groups or reorder multiple groups at once

### Organization & Management
- 🏷️ **Tag System** - Tag groups with multiple tags, filter by tags, and manage tags across all groups
- 📝 **Rename Groups** - Give meaningful names to your tab groups
- 📌 **Pin Groups** - Pin important groups to prevent accidental removal
- 🔽 **Collapse Groups** - Close all open tabs belonging to a specific group with one click
- 🔍 **Search & Filter** - Find tab groups by name or tags with powerful search functionality
- 🚫 **Blacklist Support** - Exclude specific files or patterns from being saved

### Smart Features
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Auto-Grouping** - Automatically categorize tabs using Claude API
  - Group by directory hierarchy
  - Group by file extension
  - Group by file name patterns
  - Mix multiple strategies
  - Custom user-defined strategies
- 🔀 **Git Branch Tracking** - Automatically track and restore tab state per Git branch
  - Save state when switching branches
  - Restore state when returning to a branch
  - Migrate tab state between branches
  - Browse and restore from non-active branches
- 💾 **Import/Export** - Backup and restore your entire tab database

### Advanced Sorting
- 📈 **Multiple Sorting Strategies** - Choose from:
  - **Default**: Pinned first, named, tagged, then by creation time
  - **LRU** (Least Recently Used): Recently accessed groups first
  - **LFU** (Least Frequently Used): Frequently accessed groups first

## 📋 Requirements

- VS Code 1.90.0 or higher
- Git extension (built-in) for branch tracking features
- Claude API key (optional, only for AI auto-grouping)

## 🚀 Usage

### Send tab(s) to onetab extension in right click context.

### Rename, pin, set tags, remove or restore tab groups in onetab extension

![edit_group](images/edit_group.png)

### Send tab(s) into specific tab group

![send_to_specific](images/send_to_specific.png)

### Restore or remove tab from tab group

### Send file into blacklist and edit blacklist in configuration

You can send one file to the blacklist:

![blacklist1](images/blacklist1.png)
![blacklist2](images/blacklist2.png)

### List and search tab group by their name or tags

![list_and_search](images/list_and_search.png)

### Drag and drop the tab group or tabs

![drag_and_drop](images/drag_and_drop.gif)

### Auto group by large language model's API

![autogroup](images/autogroup.gif)

There are three strategies for auto-grouping:
1. **dir** - Files' directory hierarchy
2. **ext** - File extension type (`.rs`, `.js`, etc.)
3. **filename** - File names

The UI supports a mix of multiple strategies, but single strategy's effect is the best.

**Notice**: We only support Claude API now (since it's entirely free), and you need to edit the API key in `settings.json`. Welcome to contribute and add support for other LLM APIs and our prompts!

### Track the Git branch switch and initialization

This feature will track the Git branch's switch and change the active tree view accordingly.

When you switch to a new branch, the active tree view will be clear, and the previous branch's state will be saved in the **readonly** tree view "ONETAB BRANCHES". If you switch to a branch that existed before, the original state will be restored.

You can also migrate the tab's state from one branch to the current branch.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure the extension in VS Code settings:

- **API Key**: Set your Claude API key for AI auto-grouping
- **Blacklist**: Manage files to exclude from OneTab
- **Sorting Strategy**: Choose default sorting strategy for auto-grouping
